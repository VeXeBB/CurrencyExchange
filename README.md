## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Fisrt of all download or clone the files to Your pc.

### Prerequisites

Install flask, if You don't have it (yet, if You are here on GitHub i guess You already have it ;))

```
>pip install Flask
```

### Turn on Flask on cmd

In the app.py directory type in
```
>flask run
```
Thanks to that we can call out my website in a browser.

## Lets check it out!

Once flask is running on cmd, open any browser you usually use and type in:
```
localhost:5000/kantor
```
